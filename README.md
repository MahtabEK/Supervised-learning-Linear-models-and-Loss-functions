# Supervised-learning-Linear-models-and-Loss-functions
In this project, I have worked with some data on possums. It is a relatively small data set, but it's a good size to try with ordinary least squares (OLS) and least absolute deviation (LAD), and to gain experience with supervised learning. I have written my own methods to fir both OLS and LAD models, and then at the end compared them to the models produced by the statsmodels package.
